# OVERVIEW

### What is Touchviewer?
Touchviewer is an application for creating and managing your multimedia content. It is the ideal support for real-life Multi-Touch experiences for your users, in malls, museums, sales outlets, and trade fairs.

Touchviewer helps your customers find information about your products, and helps your visitors discover, learn and explore in museums. Touchviewer lets you manage and update your content independently and without writing a single line of code. Simplicity and intuition are the winning combination.

### Create your presentations
Touchviewer has been designed and built for use via touch display, allowing users simple, intuitive navigation. With a quick gesture, you can zoom in on very high resolution images, see videos, navigate the internet, view interactive maps with points of interest, write, read and draw.  The answer to your gestures is fluid, realistic, fast and natural.

### For all touch devices
Touchviewer is the only software that allows you to automatically adapt the work screen to any display and to any resolution, from 4K monitors to infinite Touch Wall display compositions. Touchviewer can also be configured in a Multi-User version. The work area can be divided or multiple navigation menus can be activated on the screen in order to manage and share content with multiple users at the same time.
